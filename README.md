# 📘 Machine Learning & Deep Learning Roadmap with Projects

An **interactive, responsive web roadmap** that helps learners track their progress while building **real-world projects** for each Machine Learning and Deep Learning model.  
Each model is tied to:
- ✅ What it does  
- 📌 Why it matters  
- 🏗️ A practical project  
- 🔗 Dataset suggestions  
- 💻 Minimal starter code  

---

## 🚀 Features
- 📋 **Complete roadmap** (ML + DL in one place).  
- 🧑‍💻 **Projects tied to every model** → learn by building.  
- 🎯 **Track progress** with checkboxes (saved in browser).  
- 🔍 **Search/filter** topics easily.  
- 🎨 **Modern glassmorphism UI** (responsive + eye-friendly).
